\
**Features**: Guild Onboarding, Private Rentals, Custom Payment Token, Partner Fees

#### Case Study :&#x20;

\
The NFT rental case study explores the innovative application of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in the GameFi rental industry, highlighting the benefits and challenges associated with this emerging trend\
\
**Problem :**&#x20;

* _High Entry Barriers_: The exorbitant prices of NFTs create a significant barrier for student gamers and those from developing nations.
* _Low Asset Utilization_: The concentrated distribution of assets limits the NFTs' contribution to the game economy, with a considerable percentage of holders remaining inactive.
* _Monetization Challenges_: The lack of avenues for monetization from the secondary market hampers the full potential of NFT mechanics.

**Solution** :

Implementing a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) NFT sharing model aims to address these challenges, allowing gamers to earn passive income from idle NFTs.

* _Monetization_: Projects can earn royalties from a secondary NFT sharing model by setting up partner fees
* _Accessible Ownership_: NFT rentals allow individuals to experience ownership of high-value assets without the financial burden
* _Increased Engagement and Distribution_: NFT sharing lets more gamers interact with rare experiences, creating a long tail of gamers who would buy NFTs that might result in high buy pressure
* _Custom Payment Token_: Integration with in-game tokens enables a custom payment feature, potentially appreciating the value of tokens through transactions during rentals.
* _Increased Liquidity_: Enables owners to unlock liquidity by renting out assets without selling them

**Features** :

* _Guild Onboarding_: Distributing rental NFTs through guilds broadens the distribution reach, engaging a wider audience
* _Private Rentals_: NFT sharing among whitelisted addresses allows guilds to collaborate with scholars and individual gamers to form micro guilds for NFT sharing

**Conclusion**: The NFT rental case study underscores the potential to enhance engagement and financial inclusivity within the gaming community. It not only offers a solution to entry barriers but also provides game developers with a novel approach to distributing assets widely and introduces additional layers of monetization. The combined benefits of increased liquidity, accessible ownership, and streamlined processes make NFT rentals a promising frontier for ongoing exploration and innovation in the gaming industry

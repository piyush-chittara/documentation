## Lack of utility, liquidity, and accessibility hindering NFT adoption&#x20;

**NFT** space, valued at **$20 billion**, lacks utility infrastructure for on-chain communities due to a lack of industry standards to preserve on-chain ownership while sharing conditionally with beneficiaries. Unlike DeFi, NFTs require specific standards for the transfer of conditional ownership, posing a challenge to composability. \
\
As the NFT market gears up for a tenfold surge in active participants and an estimated **$130 billion** economy by 2030, addressing issues such as value flow due to frequent capital formation at mints, and lower secondary volume becomes crucial. Value redistribution mechanics need to be solved to create a vibrant liquid market for NFTs and L1s need such infrastructure to attract a larger dev and user community. Furthermore, Complicated processes for offering utility post-mint result in reduced liquidity and trading activity due to the perceived lack of utility in NFTs.

## A Primer on NFTs

The NFT market presents a significant and potentially larger opportunity than commonly perceived, with approximately **$10 billion** currently locked in NFTs. However, only about **15%** of these digital assets have a tangible purpose, leaving the majority as illiquid and speculative. Future projections estimate the NFT market to reach a valuation of **$130 billion** by 2030.

One of the key drivers of this burgeoning market is the **Web3 gaming sector**, expected to expand from $4.6 billion to an impressive **$65 billion** by 2027. Beyond gaming, the NFT ecosystem holds untapped potential, especially as the metaverse develops. Possibilities include revolutionizing commerce for digital wearables and virtual land spaces, as well as tokenizing physical assets.

As the average NFT holding period increases (currently at 35 days), there is a growing demand for short-term liquidity and additional utility for NFT holdings. Innovative solutions like a loan protocol can address this demand, offering instant borrowing options for NFT holders and potentially expanding and enhancing the NFT economy through Utility services. In summary, the NFT market not only promises substantial growth but also has the potential to create new markets and redefine interactions with digital and physical assets.

## Why StreamNFT?

\
The future for blockchain art and collectibles is undoubtedly bright, but what is perhaps more intriguing is that for all of the other potential NFT use cases. But the developer/NFT creator has less developer tooling to deliver **Defi NFTs** to their holders and relies on royalties for revenue. There is no way to add a **Utility** post mint for a developer. Additionally, writing custom contracts is a high cost and security risk. To save developer efforts in providing liquid NFTs to their holders, StreamNFT has developed a set of protocols to maximize liquidity & utility across the chain and protocol.

In essence, the current landscape represents a unique opportunity for our company to step in and lay the necessary groundwork, offering the essential infrastructure and support that the growing NFT market requires. This is the right moment to build a foundation for the future of NFTs and empower creators and developers to maximize the potential of this dynamic and evolving ecosystem.

Our company is strategically positioned to address these burgeoning needs and challenges within the NFT ecosystem. We are dedicated to tackling the critical infrastructure issues that have hindered the full realization of NFT potential. Our goal is to optimize the liquidity and utility of NFTs, making them more accessible and valuable for a diverse range of creators and developers across various domains, including GameFi, RWA, Collectibles, and Brands. We are chain-agnostic, focusing on providing comprehensive support to the ever-expanding NFT ecosystem.

The timing for our company is ideal for several compelling reasons. Currently, the NFT market has not yet fully realized its potential in terms of widespread utility.

We anticipate that the number of participants in the NFT market is set to increase dramatically, possibly by a factor of 50, over the next five years. These participants will require both liquidity and utility for their NFT assets.

# ðŸ”“ Rent Protocol

The protocol secures tokens by a set of contracts deployed that are managed by the smart contract. NFT Owner puts their NFT on rent, sets the rules of the contract, and deposits their NFT to the protocol. Borrowers, or customers, can claim the token, and get conditional ownership as parameters set by the issuer.&#x20;

The protocol works permissionless without needing any collateral and aims to solve the following :&#x20;

* The capability to share idle digital assets ( In-game assets, tokenized real estate, digital content, etc. ) for their utility and generate interest\

* Lowering the entry barrier for new consumers by providing a medium to experience at low cost and then make the buying decision\

* Simplifying asset management for institutional holders such as gaming guilds, and DAOs by enabling private rentals. They can simply whitelist the beneficiary's address ( Scholars, etc. ).&#x20;

**ðŸŒŸ Supported Chains -** Solana, Ethereum, Polygon, Hedera, Mantle, Telos, & more coming soon ( Pipeline - Avalanche, Arbitrum, Scroll, etc. )\

NFTs on EVM are not inherently lockable, therefore StreamNFT has proposed [ERC7066](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7066) to enable escrowless financialization tools on EVM. StreamNFT currently supports ERC721, ERC1155 and ERC7066 NFTs. Integration steps for these can be found [here](../for-developers/rental-integration/rental-quick/).

### Features:

Projects can customize own rental solutions using provided features:

1. **Asset Receipt**
   * Smart Registry: Low cost solution where smart contract stores the token states
   * Wrapped Token: Mint an [ERC7066](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7066) wrapped token as receipt (an extension of ERC721 and supports all ERC721 functions). [ERC7066](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7066) copy of token is transferred and locked to user wallet. Only one token is minted for each NFT and all subsequent rentals lock/unlock and transfer the wrapped token using [ERC7066](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7066) capabilities, thus making the solution gas optimal.&#x20;
2. **Private Rental**\
   Configure rental within a specific guild or targeted user base
3. **Custom Payment Token**\
   Configure rental payment in chain native token or your own ERC20 token
4. **Partner Fee**\
   Project/Collection can configure their fee, which shall be processed to partner treasury on each successful rental
5. **Reward sharing**\
   Reward NFT holders in native tokens or any ERC20 token, which gets distributed to NFT owner and NFT rentee as per configurable reward share
6. **Trials**\
   Project can choose to list NFTs on trial for no cost. Incentivising users to experience projects and NFT utilities for free.
